# US Visa Approval Prediction
Predict the outcome of US visa applications using machine learning models trained on real-world datasets. This project helps analyze visa approval trends and identifies factors that influence the decision-making process.
# Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive system that determines whether a US visa application will be certified (approved) or denied based on input features like job title, employer, wage, and location.
It combines data analysis, machine learning, and model deployment to demonstrate a complete end-to-end ML workflow.
# Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- Model Training: Multiple ML algorithms tested â€” Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
- Model Evaluation: Performance compared using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Web App Interface: Interactive frontend built for real-time predictions.
- Deployment Ready: Includes Dockerfile/requirements.txt for easy setup.
